What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	The .git directory is added to the directory. So that the history of the directory will be recorded.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

	The staging area is proposed changes, whereas the working directory all of the changes are already there
	and the repository also contains changes that exist. The staging offers the opportunity to remove changes
	you don't want to commit or to not commit certain files that you may not want to commit.

How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    It displayed the exact lines that were different between the files

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    You can see what has changed much more quickly and know what may have messed 
	up an application

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Pro: Bad versions won't be saved. Cons: A working version may be lost because 
	it wasn't commited

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Git is meant for version controlling an entire application, whereas Docs is meant 
	for managing individual documents

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    Log can be used to see which files have been changed, while diff can show the 
	specific differences between the old and new version of a file

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    Because it is much easier to undo those changes if they do break everything.
Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    Everything

When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  When you are working with other people on a project or want to share the project with
  other people.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically 
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	Because there may be conflicts with your code and what is available in the remote,
	or there may be changes in the remote that your code isnt ready to handle yet.
